# single_channel_audio_amplifier
An audio amplifier based on the LM386L IC.

The level of the music that comes out from the speaker can be adjusted by the rotary potentiometer used in the circuit. The audio amplifier has been successfully tested with a 9V battery, with a 8Î© 1W speaker and with a phone that was used as an audio source.

All the informations about the project such as the electronic components and the circuitry are listed in the file audio_amplifier.pdf.
